# Structure of the code

1. Starting from an address or an EGID, geocode the building.
2. Download the data from REA of the municipality where the building is located.
3. Estimate the demand (SH and DHW) for every building in the area.
4. Define the parameters of the network 
   (radius from the buildings and max number of connections)
5. Identify the best users in terms of demand and connect the buildings to the generator
6. Estimate general parameters of the network (demand per unit area, demand per unit length)
7. Create a plot of the area with the selected buildings

# Future developments

1. Automatize the procedure
2. Analyze different scenarios and find the optimum
